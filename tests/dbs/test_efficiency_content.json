Back two passengers passed out and as the front passenger and I were laughing about it and finishing the blunt, we must've passed out as well from lack of oxygen.

There were all sorts of crushed exoskeletons and flea feces in their fur.

            "text": "&gt;To you. Words don't belong to political parties or ideologies.\n\n\nWords have usages. And that's what the term 'conservative' us used to convey. Just because it is derived from the word conserve doesn't mean that 'conserve' and 'conservative' are interchangeable. Conservatism **is** an ideology. And I notice that you're quite happy to try and batter me over the head with a dictionary definition when it's convenient to you, but then completely ignore dictionary definitions when you discover they don't agree with you.\n\n\n\n&gt;Well again, you can't let language get hijacked by ideologies and even smaller some type of national political parties.\n\n\nOh my *god*.\n\n\nNobody is *hijacking* anything. The term \"conservatism\" was first coined in 1818 **as** a political and philosophical movement. It does not and never *has* been a synonym for \"conserve\", as you are trying to pretend.\n\n\n&gt;I was explaining to you my view of conservative values, i gave you examples and i tried to explain to you why i think conservative values are important and how i define it. \n\n\nAnd I reject the examples you offered because not a single one of them is in any way associated with the conservative ideology; in fact, many of them run directly counter to it.\n\n\n&gt;but you can't tell me the way i define conservatism on a fundamental level is wrong\n\n\nYou can define it however you want. I just think you're dishonest in doing so, and by using the term to describe something that nobody else is, you're just sowing confusion.\n\n\nWhat's more, it makes your initial objection that started this conversation meaningless and stupid. As I said, this is a thread concerning the conservative party in the UK - a party who actually *are* conservatives, and to whom the label can correctly be applied - and you marched in with your \"I don't see why people object to conservatives\" while *knowingly* using conservative to mean something completely different, and not intending to convey and ideological or political meaning whatsoever.\n\n\nDidn't you *realize* that you were muddying the waters?\n\n\n&gt;because we all know what \"conserve\" fundamentally means.\n\n\nYes. But the term 'conserve' and 'conservative' are not interchangeable. Conservatism is an ideological movement, it is not a synonym for the word 'conserve'. And your dogged determination to try and pretend that it is will not make it so.\n\n\n&gt;It seems you can't get your head out of that ideological/political box.\n\n\nBecause I know what the word means and you evidently do not.\n\n\n&gt;Well then you would stray away from the fundamental meaning of the word and go towards the ideological meaning \n\n\nNo I didn't. *Conserve* and *conservatism* **are not the same word**. The word conservatism is *derived* from the word *conserve*. But that doesn't mean they're interchangeable, anymore than the word 'bicycle' is interchangeable with the word 'two'.\n\n\n\n&gt;is the root meaning of conservatism the word \"conserve\" OR some kind of political party of ideology?\n\n\nThe word 'conservatism' is and always has been used to describe a political and philosophical ideology. You are correct that the root word for it *is* conserve, but root words are not interchangeable with the terms derived from them. \n\n\n\n\n\nWhat you are doing is indistinguishable from saying: \"I don't see why people have a problem with communism\", and then when people try to explain to you what communism is, you start arguing that you weren't talking about a political ideology, and were in fact talking about communes."

If you are willing to work hard and put in the effort, you can still find jobs that pay just as well as something you need a degree for. the problem is that most people who dont go to school do so because they dont have a good work ethic and dont put in the work, and you still need to do that even if you dont go to school. School in most cases is mainly just a certificate that proves you are capable of at least some degree of work ethic and motivation to show to a new employer, but there are other ways to prove that to someone who is hiring for a decent job."

We would ahve never survived without conserving foods with various techniques like salting, drying, pickling for last 100k years etc.\n\n\nSo all the progress we make, we also have to conserve to a certain extend. What is progress if we are not able to hold on to it as long as possible? Couple thousand years and most civilizations are just merely ruins. \n\nThe age of enlightenment was made possible because of Greek philosophy and Roman law, which we rediscovered with neo-classicism. \n\nWritten language is conserving knowledge from the past, probably the greatest tool of humanity ever."

They are were fundamental meaning is derived from. Just because i call myself god, and do that for long enough, doesn't make me god. People might start believing i am god because it is ingrained into language. That's like saying the right is right because it's right.\n\n&gt;Conservatism is an ideology. That's what the word is used to convey.\n\nWell again, you can't let language get hijacked by ideologies and even smaller some type of national political parties. \n\nI was explaining to you my view of conservative values, i gave you examples and i tried to explain to you why i think conservative values are important and how i define it. You were the one you asked. You can disagree with me about how you limit your definition of conservatism to contemporary political parties and ideologies, but you can't tell me the way i define conservatism on a fundamental level is wrong, because we all know what \"conserve\" fundamentally means. It seems you can't get your head out of that ideological/political box.\n\n&gt;because you can type \"conservatism\" into the search engine on the exact same website you just linked to,\n\nWell then you would stray away from the fundamental meaning of the word and go towards the ideological meaning and i already told you that is not how i define it as it is not  the fundamental definition of the word and it's meaning.\n\nLet me ask you one question; is the root meaning of conservatism the word \"conserve\" OR some kind of political party of ideology? Which one is more fundamental?"

            "text": "&gt;Would you agree with me on the premise that conservatism meant something different 100 years ago than what it means today?\n\n\n....No....?\n\n\n\n\n\nI literally *just* posted in my last comment that conservatism has been used to describe a political ideology since 1818.\n\n\nAre you even bothering to *read* what I'm saying to you?\n\n\nNow while it's true that the conservative platform is not universal nor necessarily static, and the conservatives ideology of today is not identical to the conservative ideology of 1818, it still satisfied the same definition: i.e. a political and philosophical movement, intended to roll back on and/or block further progressive politics and social changes.\n\n\n&gt;If we can agree on that, than why should we define the word in it's temporal definition to a higher importance, than to what it originally means?\n\n\nWell first of all, words don't have intrinsic meanings, they have usages. So it wouldn't necessarily matter what the word meant 100 years ago if it meant something different today.\n\n\nThe term \"gay\" just meant \"happy\" at one point, but now the word is generally used as a synonym for homosexuality. And if this was a thread about a group of people professing to be 'anti-gay' (which, in fact, it could very well be given the Tories have climbed into bed with the DUP), I'm sure it would agree it would be nonsensical for you to make a comment about: \"I don't understand why people are anti-gay\" meaning you don't understand why people are anti-happy.\n\n\nAnd then, when someone tried to explain to you that gay meant homosexual, you would then pretend to be mystified and argue that gay just meant happy, and that trying to apply it elsewhere was \"hijacking\" the term.\n\n\nIn any case, this is all moot. The word \"conservative\" has **never** been a synonym for the word \"conserve\", nor has it ever applied simply to people who want to \"conserve\" something. It is and always has described a political and philosophical movement.\n\n\nFor another example, 'conservationist' is a term derived from the same root word. But not only are conservationists typically not conservatives, conservatives tend to be in direct oppositions to conservationists.\n\n\n&gt;If i tell you right now from man to man what i think is valuable to be conserved for the future without implying all the baggage ideology and political stuff, could you accept my opinion as such\n\n\nYes, sure. But that's **not** \"conservatism\". And I honestly don't understand what point you're trying to make, or why you're so determined to continue down this bizare rabbit hole.\n\n\n\n&gt;You for sure understand what i am trying to communicate right?\n\n\nNo. I think you're trying to play some kind of sophistic game. And you're trying to use the term 'conservative' to mean something it doesn't and never has.\n\n\n&gt;That when i now say that i have conservative opinions that this does not imply any attachment to any conservative political party or any defined ideology, but you claim it is implied and associated by default, which it isn't.\n\n\nIf you march into a thread **about** a conservative political party and say: \"I don't see why people have a problem with conservatism\" when you **don't** mean to refer to the conservative political ideology then *you are being an idiot*! You are simply deliberately muddying the waters and sowing confusion so you can hear yourself talk and throw out sophistries.\n\n\n&gt;That's not true and exactly why we can't find common ground. Just look at 2a,b and 3.\n\n\nAll three of those definitions agree with me, not you. All three of them describe conservatism as being part of a political and philosophical position, *not* simply a synonym for \"conserving things\".\n\n\n&gt;If i was saying i don't have a problem with communism it would simply mean i don't ahve a problem with communism. \n\n\nThen why are you using the phrase: \"I don't have a problem with conservatism\" to mean: \"I don't have a problem with conserving things\"?\n\n\n&gt;Do you see what you are doing? \n\n\nPointing out the flaw in your sophistry?\n\n\n&gt;In order to understand what i mean by that you would have to ask me how i define communism\n\n\nAnd if you defined communism as \"communes\", then you would be **wrong**. Because that isn't what communism is, and it isn't the usage that is applied to the word in any sense. Just as you are both wholly incorrect and being deliberately obtuse to try and argue that \"conservatism\" can be accurately described as \"wanting to conserve things\".\n\n\n\n&gt;you don't just jump to conclusion based on your own understanding.\n\n\nAgain, I'm going to try pointing this out one more time, because for some reason it isn't sinking in:\n\n\nYou walked into a thread about a conservative political party. And invoked the term \"conservative\" to mean something that is your own particular usage of the word, that you **knew** had nothing whatsoever to do with the political position that the term 'conservative' describes.\n\n\nAnd now you're accusing me of \"leaping to conclusions\" as to what you meant? And trying to lecture me as if I had no justification for assuming you were using the word 'conservative' in the same way that everyone else aside from you does? \n\n\nDo you not see how *absurd* that is? And how it would lead me to wonder whether or not you are simply deliberately trolling at this point?\n\n\n&gt;You act like the word \"communism\" has the same complexity as the word \"blue\"\n\n\nJesus Christ you are just being obnoxious at this point. I **clearly** explained what I meant. While it's true that you might need to properly define whatever aspect of communism you did or didn't object to, the point I was making was that it would be nonsensical for - when the conversation started - to try and argue that by \"communism\" you were referring to \"communes\". Which is what you are attempting to do with conservatism by saying \"I was talking about the verb 'to conserve'.\"\n\n\n\nYou are, not for the first time, showing that you are either not reading what's actually being said to you, or you are simply determined to continue arguing sophistry rather than addressing the actual points.\n\n\n&gt;like \"conservatism\" if the other person already told you the etymological meaning and how he defines it?\n\n\n*No*. We agreed what the root word for conservatism is. That doesn't mean that conservatism and its root word are interchangable and if you think that's the case then you don't understand what a root word is.\n\n\nEspecially as *I've* explained to you what the word 'conservative' meant when it was first coined in 1818 as a political and philosophical movement. *Not* the usage that you attempting to apply to it.\n\n\n&gt;while in reality all it is, is a temporary umbrella word derived from the word \"to conserve\" which comes from the latin \"con-servare\".\n\n\nI. Don't. Care. What. It's. Derived. From. We've already agreed what the word is derived from and that makes *no difference whatsoever* to what the usage of the word is.\n\n\nThe **only** value that words have is in their current usage, which is exactly what you're attempting to dismiss. And I've already given you several examples that underpin how nonsensical your position is.\n\n\nI think this conservation is pretty much over. All you want to do is hear yourself talk and play at sophistry. And it's a game I'm not going to continue playing with you.\n\n\nThe word 'conservative' is used to describe a political and philosophical ideology. It does not simply mean a desire to conserve things.\n\n\nDeal with it."

            "description": "Support for you and baby. The original award-winning Boppy Pillow. The Boppy Bare Naked Feeding and Infant Support Pillow ergonomically supports you while nursing or bottle feeding. Versatile to grow and support baby during supervised awake time through first year milestones. Feeding (0+ months), propping (3+ months), tummy time (6+ months) and sitting (9+ months). Created by a mother, this pillow is designed with your comfort in mind. So, get comfortable. Small enough to fit in a rocking chair while nursing or bottle feeding, but large enough to give the lift you and baby need. You can place the pillow around your front or side waist to get the best support for your feeding style: cradle, cross cradle, football hold or bottle feeding. The Boppy Bare Naked Feeding and Infant Support Pillow is created to customize. Personalize with your choice of Boppy Slipcovers sold separately. Boppy Slipcovers are available in breathable cotton, soft microfiber, organics and cozy options to fit your needs and style and guarantee a perfect fit. Nursing, propping, tummy time, sitting  the Boppy Bare Naked Feeding and Infant Support Pillow gives awake-time support throughout babys first year. Recommended age: 0-12 months. Designed for your baby's supervised, awake time. This product is not for sleep. Thank you to the millions of parents who trust Boppy. Answering the questions many new parents have: The Pillow or the Newborn Lounger? Both the Boppy Pillow and Boppy Newborn Lounger are for supervised awake time only and not for sleep. The Boppy Pillow is a feeding pillow from day one but acts as a baby support for propping at 3 months. The Newborn Lounger is that place for newborns (0-4 months) to hang out when you need a hands-free moment when baby is awake. Its lightweight with a carrying handle so it easily goes where you are. The Newborn Lounger is not for nursing. Hope that helps."

            "description": "\"The OEMTOOLS Universal Cooling System Filler purges those problematic airlocks, checks for vacuum leaks, and then allows the technician to refill the system quickly and easily. USE IS SIMPLE: 1. Before beginning, the radiator must be completely drained of fluid. And the car should be engaged and the heater turned on, so that the heater coil is open and can be evacuated and refilled. 2. Find the right sized rubber bush for your radiator neck or coolant reservoir, and then fit the gauged cooling system adapter firmly into place. Turn the tightener on the valve clockwise until it snugly fits the radiator neck. 3. Connect venturi valve to the cooling system adapter, connect shop air to the venturi valve, and connect evacuator hose to the other side of the venture valve; make sure all valve openings are closed until the shop air is connected. 4. The hose on the other side of the venturi valve may evacuate fluid, if any is trapped in the system, so you may want to place that tube into a waste fluid pan. 5. Once the air line is attached, open the venturi valve, and the intermediate valve on the adapter assembly; Draw vacuum until the gauge reads between 50 and 60 cmHG) 6. Close the intermediate valve and venturi valve. If the vacuum drops, you have a leak in your system. If it does not, youre ready to refill your coolant. 7. Connect your coolant hose. Drop the other end into a large container of coolant, mixed to your preferred specifications. Open the coolant tube valve, and the coolant will flow. Use a large container so that you wont run out and introduce air to the coolant system. 8. When the gauge reaches 0 or the coolant stops flowing."

Created by a mother, this pillow is designed with your comfort in mind. So, get comfortable. Small enough to fit in a rocking chair while nursing or bottle feeding, but large enough to give the lift you and baby need. You can place the pillow around your front or side waist to get the best support for your feeding style: cradle, cross cradle, football hold or bottle feeding. The Boppy Original Feeding and Infant Support Pillow comes with a removable, breathable pillow cover with an easy-on covered zipper design. The pillow and the pillow cover are machine washable.

The Newborn Lounger is that place for newborns (0-4 months) to hang out when you need a hands-free moment when baby is awake. Its lightweight with a carrying handle so it easily goes where you are. The Newborn Lounger is not for nursing. Hope that helps. Product Care-Slipcover: Machine wash separately, delicate cycle, 30C/85F. Tumble dry low on delicate cycle. Cool iron as needed.

This portable snack bowl allows independent toddlers to self-feed with a bit more dexterity and a lot less mess. Kids love accessing snacks all by themselves through the soft, flexible flaps, and moms love that those same flaps help prevent food spills all over the house and car. Each spill proof Snack Catcher cup has two handles designed for even the littlest hands to grasp easily, and a no slip rubber bottom to keep it in place on the dinner table, in the high chair, or during lunchtime at school. Snack Catcher food containers are a must have for toddlers on the move. And because snacks come out only when they want them to, snack time no longer means food everywhere except your child's mouth. Win for all. By Munchkin."

The uniquely recessed design gently cradles baby during supervised awake time. It is lightweight with a simple carrying handle making the Newborn Lounger easy to move from room to room. You can watch baby and get things done while satisfying babys curiosity by providing different views and environments. The Boppy Newborn Lounger is not for sleep. Have baby right next to you while you brush your hair (no judgement if it has been a while), make a meal, work out, work from home, or get things done around the house. It is also a perfect place for baby and siblings to get to know each other. The lightweight design makes it easy to take with you to familys and friends houses so you know there will be a comfortable place for baby to lounge during awake time while visiting. The Boppy Newborn Lounger comes in a breathable fabric with an all-over print. No zippers or buttons so it is super comfy for baby. It is wipeable for those little oopsie messes and machine washable for those oh no ones. Answering the questions many new parents have: The Newborn Lounger or the Boppy Pillow? Both the Boppy Newborn Lounger and Boppy Pillow are for supervised awake time only and not for sleep. The Newborn Lounger is that place for newborns (0-4 months) to hang out when you need a hands-free moment when baby is awake. The Boppy Pillow is a feeding pillow from day one but acts as a baby support after 3 months old for propping (3+ months), tummy time (6+ months) and sitting (9+ months). The Newborn Lounger is not for nursing. Hope that helps."

They made makeshift outdoor housings out of milk jugs, 3D printings, and bird houses. Theyre tenacity to go beyond our prescribed instruction has made it clear we need to meet them with a camera that can keep up with their curiosity. Capturing the world cant happen when youre limited to your living room, so we created a camera that goes beyond that. We spent two years on phone calls that carried into the next morning; on international flights where sleep became a luxury; and on user interviews listening to what you wanted to see in an outdoor camera. All leading up to a camera worthy of looking after your home and those within it. We cut wires, removed boundaries, and lab tested under every extreme condition imaginable. Weve built you a battle-hardened camera capable of going places your indoor camera wouldnt even dream aboutthriving in the rains of Seattle all the way to the heatwaves of Miami and everything in between.

The WEN Magnetic Dipstick extends the lifespan of your inverter generator by catching the loose metal filaments that naturally build up inside the oil tank. Simply replace your current dipstick with this heavy duty metal alternative to begin collecting any unwanted metal shards floating around in your oil supply. The industrial-strength magnetic tip catches these deposits, allowing users to remove them from the tank by simply taking out the dipstick, while its rubber seal prevents oil from being spilled during operation and transportation. This dipstick has been specifically designed to fit the WEN 56125i 1250-Watt Inverter Generator, the WEN 56200i 2000-Watt Inverter Generator, the WEN 56202i & 56203i Super Quiet 2000-Watt Gas-Powered Inverter Generator with Fuel Shut Off CARB Compliant, the WEN 56225i 2250-Watt Inverter Generator, the WEN 56235i Super Quiet 2350-Watt Inverter Generator with Fuel Shut Off, the WEN 56310i & 56310i-RV 3100-Watt Inverter Generator, and the WEN 56380i 3800-Watt Inverter Generator, the WEN GN400i RV-Ready 4000-Watt Open Frame Inverter Generator, and the WEN DF400i Super Quiet 4000-Watt Duel Fuel Inverter Generator. However, even though it was constructed with WEN in mind, its universal M18 x 2.5 design also works with the majority of inverter generators on the market, including the Yamaha EF2000iS, Yamaha EF1000iS, Generac IQ2000, and the Predator 2000. Remember when you could maximize the lifespan of your engine? Remember WEN."

It's not just about kicking a rubber tire, it symbolizes an exciting purchase that you seldom get to make. Plus at the end of it all, you get to drive away with a shiny brand new car! The product specialists at Chemical Guys wanted to recreate that kickable bright shine, so they came up with Tire Kicker Extra Shiny Tire Shine Spray. Now as your car ages with thousands of well-traveled miles on the clock, you can enjoy the same bright wet shine on your tires that you kicked in the showroom. Chemical Guys R&D blended premium water-based dressing, extra gloss enhancers, and UV blockers into a slick spray able formula. Tire Kicker isn't just for rubber tires, try it on textured plastic, rubber, and vinyl parts as well. Mist a light coat of Tire Kicker Tire Shine over faded plastic mirrors, bumper parts, grilles, and grates to restore a deep-black new look. Rub some Tire Kicker into dashboards, door panels, and vinyl seats to enhance a bright wet shine on interior car parts as well. The easy-to-use formula finishes dry to the touch; simply wipe any excess product to avoid dripping, running, and any tire sling all over the sides of the vehicle once you drive away. Now anyone can enjoy the bright wet shine of brand-new cars with Chemical Guys Tire Kicker Extra Shiny Tire Shine Spray."

By squeezing this giant plush into a 13.5D x 7.5W x 17.5H box, weve done the unthinkable! Not only does this make for a super exciting unboxing experience, but you can now easily store away or hide this jumbo gift until the gift-giving moment. But the fun and laughs most certainly shouldnt end there  watch your littles turn into their favorite Sqoosh2Poof character or mix and match the adorable cutout face masks for a fun time and even sillier photo-op! We have also included a fun word find and coloring pages for your little to enjoy while you wait for your Sqoosh2Poof to reach its full POOFtential either in the dryer or placed in a warm/dry spot overnight. For (almost) instant fun, we recommend using a dryer to poof your Sqoosh2Poof once its been released from its compression bag. A quick 10 minutes in your dryer on your lowest heat setting will do the trick! However, if a dryer is not easily accessible, a few big shakes and a flat surface in the sun and/or overnight for your Sqoosh2Poof to sit will also achieve the same results!"

The smallest are good for small play food items, or they'd hold a couple of sets of keys. They feel sturdy and are a nice clean off white/natural color. They nest inside one another if you need to store them. I'll probably end up with a 3rd set at some point as I continue my battle against household clutter."

To Use: Place large tube against child's nostril (not inside), creating a seal. Use red mouthpiece to snuck out snot. Tips: (1) Spraying saline solution in each nostril will help loosen thick mucus before using NoseFrida. (2) Move tube in a circular motion against nostril. You will hear and see mucus coming out of nose. (3) Change filter after each use to maintain suction."

The uniquely recessed design gently cradles baby during supervised awake time. It is lightweight with a simple carrying handle making the Newborn Lounger easy to move from room to room. You can watch baby and get things done while satisfying babys curiosity by providing different views and environments. The Boppy Newborn Lounger is not for sleep. Have baby right next to you while you brush your hair (no judgement if it has been a while), make a meal, work out, work from home, or get things done around the house. It is also a perfect place for baby and siblings to get to know each other. The lightweight design makes it easy to take with you to familys and friends houses so you know there will be a comfortable place for baby to lounge during awake time while visiting. The Boppy Newborn Lounger comes in a breathable fabric with an all-over print. No zippers or buttons so it is super comfy for baby. It is wipeable for those little oopsie messes and machine washable for those oh no ones. Answering the questions many new parents have: The Newborn Lounger or the Boppy Pillow? Both the Boppy Newborn Lounger and Boppy Pillow are for supervised awake time only and not for sleep. The Newborn Lounger is that place for newborns (0-4 months) to hang out when you need a hands-free moment when baby is awake. The Boppy Pillow is a feeding pillow from day one but acts as a baby support after 3 months old for propping (3+ months), tummy time (6+ months) and sitting (9+ months). The Newborn Lounger is not for nursing. Hope that helps."

            "category": "Automotive",
            "description": "Our World-famous Wideband O2 air/fuel ratio UEGO gauge features a digital LED display and sweeping LED 'needle' that changes colors as AFR changes from rich to lean. A 52mm (2-1/16\") gauge housing ensures that it will fit in most gauge pods and can be remotely mounted virtually anywhere. All AEM digital gauges feature a 0-5V analog output for use with data loggers and almost any engine management system. Each gauge comes with black and silver bezels and black and white faceplates for multiple color combinations and a custom look (a black Lambda faceplate and black and white Air/Fuel Ratio faceplates). The Bosch UEGO sensor gives the controller its speed and accuracy. The Bosch 4.9 LSU sensor used in the AEM Wideband UEGO AFR Controller Gauge has a faster light off time and draws less current than the 4.2 LSU sensor used with AEM's 30-4100 Wideband UEGO Controller Gauge, which will be superseded to the gauge in August, 2014. The 4.9 LSU sensor features the same fuel compatibility as the 4.2 LSU and NEVER requires free-air calibration when used with AEM's Wideband UEGO AFR Gauge. The 4.9 LSU sensor uses a different connector than the connector used with the 4.2 LSU sensors included with the original 30-4100 gauge controller. The sensors are not interchangeable between the two gauge controllers in any way, including changing connectors on the gauges. The Wideband O2 air/fuel ratio UEGO gauge is a must if you want to maximize your engine's power and safety. When tuning an engine, accurate air/fuel ratio data is critical because running with too rich of an AFR can cause a loss of power, and running a lean AFR can result in serious engine damage. AEM's digital Wideband AFR UEGO gauge can quickly alert you to even a .1 change in air/fuel ratio and provide enough time to shut down an engine before damage occurs. There are two harnesses that connect to the back of the AEM UEGO gauge. The longer harness connects to the UEGO sensor. The shorter harness contains four leads."

Our latest and greatest PPS system features improvements like a quarter-turn locking collar with each lid, new paint cup in each kit, domed lid design for better spray performance, wider lid fluid spout and redesigned adapter for a more stable lid-to-gun connection. Each paint cup has convenient printed-on universal mix ratios for accurate mixing and a clear access window for easy visibility. Each lid strains paint material with a built-in 200-micron filter, commonly used for solvent-based paint materials. Unlike conventional aluminum or other metal paint cup systems, with PPS you dont have to mix paint in extra cups and filter it into a paint reservoir, so you waste less paint.

Mica pigment powder is used to create amazingly bright and vivid makeup, lipstick, lip balm, eye shadows, etc. The rainbow powders are childrens delight when it comes to finding a perfect slime making kit, creating sparkly slime. These soap making Mica powder pigments are fast melting dyes which do not migrate and keep vivid contours for a long time, thus are ideally suitable for handmade soap creation. Add mica powder at the proportion of 0.002-0.007 oz. per 3.5 oz. (100 grams) of soap base. While pouring the soap into the mold, sprinkle some ethanol during and after the soap base is poured, to avoid the bubble forming. The 3.5 lbs. of the base completely cool down in the mold in 5 minutes. DIY soap dyes are widely used for producing unique colorful soap or as organic soap dye supplies. These dyes for soap making do not work well for cold process soap making though. Soap colorant does not get absorbed by skin, leaves no traces, keeps its brightness and does not fade. These Mica Powder dyes are the ultimate choice both for beginners and experts in soap, epoxy resin or cosmetics making."

This backless booster seat is built for comfort with a padded seat and height-adjustable armrests. It's a terrific option to help protect older children and kids who are ready to transition out of a harness booster, but not yet ready to ride with just your vehicle's seat belt. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, school-aged children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat until at least age 8 or until the seat belt fits correctly. The Backless TurboBooster car seat is designed to protect children ages 4 to 10 who are between 40 and 100 lbs and 43 to 57 inches tall. Dual, hideaway cup holders are just right for holding your child's cups or water bottles, so that they've got just what they need for a comfortable ride in the car with you. After all, a comfortable passenger is a happy passenger. When you're ready to clean your deluxe, padded seat cushion, simply remove it and wash it in your washing machine with gentle detergent. Then, all plastic parts of the seat may be cleaned with mild soap and water. The Backless TurboBooster seat has been engineered and rigorously crash tested to meet or exceed all applicable US standards.

According to the American Academy of Pediatrics and the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, school-aged children should ride in a belt-positioning booster seat until at least age 8 or until the seat belt fits correctly. The Backless TurboBooster car seat is designed to protect children ages 4 to 10 who are between 40 and 100 lbs and 43 to 57 inches tall. Dual, hideaway cup holders are just right for holding your child's cups or water bottles, so that they've got just what they need for a comfortable ride in the car with you. After all, a comfortable passenger is a happy passenger. When you're ready to clean your deluxe, padded seat cushion, simply remove it and wash it in your washing machine with gentle detergent. Then, all plastic parts of the seat may be cleaned with mild soap and water. The Backless TurboBooster seat has been engineered and rigorously crash tested to meet or exceed all applicable US standards. Product information/Technical Details Chart: Minimum height recommendation: 43 inches Maximum height recommendation: 57 inches."

This results in sharper images with less motion blur and reduced need to use flash in dimly lit conditions so you can easily capture the atmosphere of a low light environment. The 50mm focal length allows you to fill the frame with your subject from a comfortable distance making it a great lens for portraits. A similar perspective to the human eye and its compact size make the EF 50mm f/1.8 STM a great everyday lens to always carry with your EOS camera. The near-silent STM (Stepping Motor) technology focuses extremely quickly when shooting photos, so you can react suddenly to capture fleeting moments. Creating high quality movies is easier with STM as it delivers steady and quiet continuous focusing, so your movies are smooth, and soundtracks only capture the surrounding sounds and not the noise of a focusing motor. The EF 50mm f/1.8 STM replaces the popular EF 50mm f/1.8 II lens which was affectionately known for giving outstanding picture quality at an affordable price. This latest version gives the same stunning photo quality but with a fast, near-silent focus motor and a more robust build that belies its price."

            "description": "These unscented, hypoallergenic baby wipes contain 99.9% water and a drop of fruit & berry extract, making them perfect for use on hands, faces, and bottoms. The textured surface provides a little extra cleansing power to tackle lifes messes. From feeding your growing baby purees and solids, to art projects, playtime, diaper changes and more, WaterWipes with Soapberry combine the purity of water with the natural cleansing power of soapberry. Chosen for its natural and hypoallergenic cleaning properties, Soapberry is a cherry-like fruit whose outer pulp is a rich source of a gentle natural cleanser called saponin. This cleanser, known for its skin conditioning properties, has been used by people across Europe and Asia for centuries. Just as pure as WaterWipes original and awarded the National Eczema Association of America Seal of Acceptance, WaterWipes with Soapberry will provide a gentle clean on messy faces, hands, and bottoms. Our story: WaterWipes were created by our founder Edward McCloskey after his newborn daughter suffered with bad diaper rash. After an extensive search, he couldnt find a baby wipe that didnt contain harmful ingredients that was suitable for her sensitive skin, so he decided to make his own. Many years later and after a lot of hard work, testing, and scientific research, WaterWipes were born. Pure, gentle, and safe for the most delicate skin, yet as convenient as a regular diaper wipe. Every day, parents around the world are discovering the benefits of our gentle and safe WaterWipes for their babys skin; we hope you like them too. Our commitment to you: At WaterWipes, we pride ourselves on making the worlds purest baby water wipe for newborn and sensitive skin. We fully understand that we also have a responsibility to help protect the planet your little one will inherit. Our biodegradable wipes are made from 100% viscose, a renewable, plant-based material which contains zero plastic. Viscose has a silky soft feel on babys skin and is strong, meaning it wont break apart in your hand, so you can clean and change your baby with confidence. The terms \"flushable\" and \"biodegradable\" are often used interchangeably, but they are very different. No water wipes, including biodegradable wipes, should be flushed. This is because even flushable wipes take time to break down in our sewer systems. Disposing of wet wipes with household trash is the best way to help protect our environment."
